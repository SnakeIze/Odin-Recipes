     <p> <strong class="colored">HOW TO MAKE KIMCHI</strong> – a quick and easy recipe that only takes 30 minutes of hands-on time before mother nature takes over! Full of healthy, gut-healing probiotics, the benefits of eating kimchi are endless. This authentic kimchi recipe is vegan adaptable, gluten-free and can be made as spicy or as mild as you like!</p>
     <h2 class="titles">WHY EAT KIMCHI</h2> 
     <p>Because kimchi is naturally fermented, it is full of healthy bacteria, good for the gut and good for immunity. But besides being a healthy thing to incorporate into our diets, Kimchi adds so much flavor to things we are already making at home!</p>

    <h3 class="titles">MAKE THE KIMCHI PASTE:</h3> 
    <p> <li>As I stated earlier, I prefer to use Korean Chili Flakes called “Gochugaru” vs. the Korean fermented Chili Paste called “Gochujang“. Feel free to use Gochujang if you please. Totally up to you. Either way, you will make the paste below.</li> </p>
    <p> <li>Many people ask if they can use regular old chili flakes- yes, but they are much spicier!!! Gochugaru is fruitier and less spicy, so you can use more and get more flavor. You could try subbing dried Arbol Chilies if you absolutely can’t get the Korean Chili flakes – or even use fresh red chilies to make the paste.</li> </p>
    <p> <li>In a food processor, make a paste with garlic, ginger, shallot, Korean chili flakes  (or Gochujang) and optional fish sauce (or miso) and sugar. If you want a mild version, use half the chili flakes. The fish sauce really adds a delicious complexity and depth, but you can, of course, keep it vegan.</li> </p>
    <p> <li>Peel and cut the daikon radish (or carrot)  into match sticks, about 2-3 inches long. Cut the scallions.</li> </p>
    <p> <li>Cut the scallions into 1-2 inch pieces.</li> </p>   
    <p> <li>Place the drained cabbage along with the daikon, scallions and chili paste into the bowl. Massage a bit with gloved hands.</li> </p>
    <p> <li>Pack this tightly into a large two-quart jar  (half-gallon, 64 oz) or large crock. (Or use two, quart-sized mason jars.)</li> </p>
    <p> <li>Pour a little of the brine into the jar, just to enough to cover the cabbage.</li> </p>
    <p> <li>Cover with the cabbage leaf you saved, and press down. The leaf will help keep the cabbage submerged. Add a fermentation weight to keep the cabbage submerged. Cover with a lid ( do not screw on tight)  and place on a rimmed pan or bowl ( to collect any overflow) and set somewhere cool and dark like the basement for 3-5 days. A lower kitchen cabinet away from stove or appliances can also be a good cool spot.
    </li> </p>
    <p> <li>After 3 days. Tap the jar to see if any bubbles rise to the top- indicating that it is fermenting; if it is, then it's ready to be enjoyed!</li> </p>
